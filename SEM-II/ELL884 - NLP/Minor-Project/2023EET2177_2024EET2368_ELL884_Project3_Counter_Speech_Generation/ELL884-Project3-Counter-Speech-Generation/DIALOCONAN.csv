Weâ€™ve just imported 20k ticking time bombs from Afghanistan and we have homeless veterans getting arrested for begging in the street!,MIGRANTS,0,0,HS,dialo_gold
Surely people who also risked their lives to help our forces also need us to honour our promises?,MIGRANTS,0,1,CN,dialo_gold
Our own must always come first. We have at least 13k homeless ex-soldiers sleeping rough,MIGRANTS,0,2,HS,dialo_gold
"We also have at least 1 million empty homes. There are many reasons for the housing shortage, but newly arrived Afghans is not one of them.",MIGRANTS,0,3,CN,dialo_gold
Our soldiers are left to rot on our streets while we house terrorists and child groomers,MIGRANTS,0,4,HS,dialo_gold
Neither of those statements is true. I saw scared kids and families coming off those planes from Kabul but you just want to bang on about â€˜time bombsâ€™. I think you have a different agenda.,MIGRANTS,0,5,CN,dialo_gold

Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!,POC,1,0,HS,dialo_gold
Whatâ€™s racist about it?,POC,1,1,CN,dialo_gold
It segregates people based on their colour.,POC,1,2,HS,dialo_gold
Isnâ€™t it more about making visible whatâ€™s been largely invisible?,POC,1,3,CN,dialo_gold
It should be called what it really isâ€¦Bad mouth whitesâ€™ month,POC,1,4,HS,dialo_gold
I think the title is perfectâ€¦signifying a celebration of individual and collective achievements.,POC,1,5,CN,dialo_gold
Itâ€™s fake and harmful racial hatred driven by people who profit from it.,POC,1,6,HS,dialo_gold
"I donâ€™t see expressions of hatred, but Iâ€™d agree there is a profit for us all in understanding a largely hidden part of our shared histories.",POC,1,7,CN,dialo_gold
Thereâ€™s a rumour that Terry Gilliamâ€™s new production has been cancelled because the theatre is concerned about his anti-trans statements. More cancel culture madness!,LGBT+,2,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Its only a rumour, and he has grown into a curmudgeon in his old age. ðŸ˜Š",LGBT+,2,1,CN,dialo_gold
Its dangerous censorship and an assault on free speech.,LGBT+,2,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If the cancellation is true, then surely itâ€™s a theatre sticking by its principles and reminding us that rights also bring responsibilities.",LGBT+,2,3,CN,dialo_gold
What about freedom of expression in the arts?,LGBT+,2,4,HS,dialo_gold
But the rumoured cancellation is not related to the play he was planning.,LGBT+,2,5,CN,dialo_gold
We need to protect our right to cause offence.,LGBT+,2,6,HS,dialo_gold
"But, he hasnâ€™t lost that right, just had a reminder that what we say affects how people view and treat us.",LGBT+,2,7,CN,dialo_gold
More migrants crossing the channel today. We donâ€™t have enough accommodation. Our own homeless are forgotten. Send them back.,MIGRANTS,3,0,HS,dialo_gold
Are you forgetting that last year every rough sleeper was offered a bed during lockdown?,MIGRANTS,3,1,CN,dialo_gold
During lockdown.,MIGRANTS,3,2,HS,dialo_gold
If thereâ€™s a will thereâ€™s a way.,MIGRANTS,3,3,CN,dialo_gold
We donâ€™t have enough accommodation.,MIGRANTS,3,4,HS,dialo_gold

Nice to see somewhere celebrating diversity and inclusivity.,LGBT+,4,1,CN,dialo_gold
Its political correctness gone mad!,LGBT+,4,2,HS,dialo_gold

I just read that the Home office is handing out mobile phones to migrant invaders so that they can progress their asylum claims â€¦ you couldnâ€™t make this up!,MIGRANTS,5,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Yeah, I saw a blog post that mentioned this but just quoted a â€˜source in the Home officeâ€™, which is a bit dodgy.",MIGRANTS,5,1,CN,dialo_gold
We should be sinking the boats not handing out phones!,MIGRANTS,5,2,HS,dialo_gold
I donâ€™t think drowning desperate people is a solution.,MIGRANTS,5,3,CN,dialo_gold
Our traitor politicians are enabling invasion.,MIGRANTS,5,4,HS,dialo_gold
"To be fair, there seems to be plenty of evidence of the contrary.",MIGRANTS,5,5,CN,dialo_gold
By handing out mobiles at the taxpayersâ€™ expense?,MIGRANTS,5,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Iâ€™ve seen more about Border Force routinely confiscating phones to look for data about the trafficking gangsâ€¦which seems more likely to me. That, and the fact I keep seeing charities asking for donations of old phones for asylum seekers?",MIGRANTS,5,7,CN,dialo_gold
"All credit to the Poles, they know how to control their borders. Bats and rubber bulletsâ€¦Iâ€™d happily volunteer!",MIGRANTS,6,0,HS,dialo_gold
Donâ€™t you think itâ€™s a pity that a country that suffered so much under totalitarianism now adopts the same tactics?,MIGRANTS,6,1,CN,dialo_gold
A proud country preventing an invasion.,MIGRANTS,6,2,HS,dialo_gold
By beating back people caught in a crisis not of their own making?,MIGRANTS,6,3,CN,dialo_gold
An army of potential terrorists and child molesters.,MIGRANTS,6,4,HS,dialo_gold
We must be watching different news channels. All I see are desperate people and frightened kids all seeking a safe haven.,MIGRANTS,6,5,CN,dialo_gold
social media is banging on about the MOBO Awards again. When will we see awards for Music of WHITE Origin?,POC,7,0,HS,dialo_gold
Who would you nominate? Ed Sheeran? ðŸ™‚,POC,7,1,CN,dialo_gold

"All of the 50 criminals due to be deported yesterday to Jamaica, were removed from a chartered flight after appeals by Human Rights Lawyers.",POC,8,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Surely, if the deportations were halted, these people had at the very least, grounds for appeal?",POC,8,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Its just a gravy train for leftie lawyers, all paid for by the tax payer. Foreigners shouldnâ€™t have access to legal aid.",POC,8,2,HS,dialo_gold
"You donâ€™t believe that people, regardless of any allegation, deserve a fair trial?",POC,8,3,CN,dialo_gold
Itâ€™s a bloody disgrace that we canâ€™t get rid of foreign child molesters and rapists.,POC,8,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Whatever the criminal offence, these appeals are about the legality of the deportation, a complex area of law and hence why its one of the few grounds for entitlement to legal aid. Back to ensuring people get a fair trial.",POC,8,5,CN,dialo_gold
The legal system isnâ€™t fit for purpose!,POC,8,6,HS,dialo_gold

They need to stop using the Racism cardâ€¦its just meaningless anti-white bullshit used to guilt-trip whites! We are sick of it!,MUSLIMS,9,2,HS,dialo_gold
"As a â€˜white personâ€™ I donâ€™t feel guilty, but Iâ€™m happy to call out racism and Islamophobia when I encounter it.",MUSLIMS,9,3,CN,dialo_gold
Islam isnâ€™t a raceâ€¦itâ€™s a death cult and incompatible with British society.,MUSLIMS,9,4,HS,dialo_gold
Iâ€™d suggest that racism and Islamophobia are contrary to British values of equality and religious freedom.,MUSLIMS,9,5,CN,dialo_gold
This is a Christian country.,MUSLIMS,9,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Again, Iâ€™d disagree since my experience is of a multi-faith society. Besides, Iâ€™ve never voted based on the stated religion of a candidate.",MUSLIMS,9,7,CN,dialo_gold

"Well, they do. Using churches as homeless shelters has become common in recent years, so Iâ€™d guess the church in question already had the experience to help these desperate people.",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,1,CN,dialo_gold
Its giving succour to the enemy!,MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Come on, its charity, what good Christians believe in.",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Theyâ€™re muzzies, they should be in a mosque!",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,4,HS,dialo_gold

We should be sending they back not feeding and clothing them.,MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,6,HS,dialo_gold
Have you not read the story of the Good Samaritan? Isnâ€™t this what Jesus would want from his flock?,MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,7,CN,dialo_gold
Another County Cricket Club Chairman has resigned over â€˜historicâ€™ racist remarks from 4 years ago. This is becoming a witch hunt!,POC,11,0,HS,dialo_gold
"I donâ€™t think racism was any more acceptable 4 years ago, than it is today.",POC,11,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Who remembers what they said 4 years ago? End of cricket, the white man canâ€™t play anymore!",POC,11,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I think Iâ€™d remember an unacceptable and deeply offensive insult, regardless of how long ago, and of course white people can play cricket, they just need to learn not be racists.",POC,11,3,CN,dialo_gold
"This is about silencing the majority, so they donâ€™t complain about being replaced.",POC,11,4,HS,dialo_gold
Nahâ€¦just about ensuring players can thrive and arenâ€™t insulted and abused just because of who they are.,POC,11,5,CN,dialo_gold
"We pick them up in the Channel, ferry them to Dover, house them in hotels, provide free food and an allowance. We welcome them, so no wonder they come.",MIGRANTS,12,0,HS,dialo_gold
They come because they are desperate. Would you risk the sea in an open boat for a free pizza and a flea-pit hotel?,MIGRANTS,12,1,CN,dialo_gold
"We donâ€™t need them, and we canâ€™t even look after our own. We need to turn them back, not let them in.",MIGRANTS,12,2,HS,dialo_gold
"What about the so-called â€˜proud traditionâ€™ of welcoming those fleeing for their lives and our commitment to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which we had a hand in drafting?",MIGRANTS,12,3,CN,dialo_gold
"These are â€˜Economic migrantsâ€™ or worse. If they were asylum seekers, they would claim sanctuary in the nearest safe country.",MIGRANTS,12,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Most do. Although, as you will now, The Convention does not require refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach or make it illegal to seek asylum if a claimant has passed through another safe country.",MIGRANTS,12,5,CN,dialo_gold
The indigenous people of Britain are being replaced!,MIGRANTS,12,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Thatâ€™s a different issued and while I disagree, I havenâ€™t got time to debate the notions of â€˜Britishnessâ€™ today. Letâ€™s just hope that there are no more tragedies due to the channel crossing. You take care and have a nice day.",MIGRANTS,12,7,CN,dialo_gold
"How come these â€˜desperateâ€™ migrants all have mobiles, designer gear, trainers and can afford to pay thousands to people smugglers?",MIGRANTS,13,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Some will have sold homes, businesses, possessions. Others will be supported by family networks, loans from dear friends. â€˜Desperateâ€™ doesnâ€™t always mean â€˜poorâ€™. Many will be professionals, civil servants, lawyers, teachers.",MIGRANTS,13,1,CN,dialo_gold

"Young men of fighting age, an invading army.",MIGRANTS,13,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Fleeing war, forced conscription, religious and political persecution, fear. Ask yourself, how bad would things have to be, to leave your home, family and country and face the ordeal these people have subjected themselves to?",MIGRANTS,13,5,CN,dialo_gold
"We are full, we donâ€™t need anymore migrants or asylum seekers.",MIGRANTS,14,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Population density varies and this, along with other factors like a failure to build homes causes local shortages but to say we are â€˜fullâ€™ is not true or accurate. At the last count there were over 1 million empty properties in the UK.",MIGRANTS,14,1,CN,dialo_gold
So why are people homeless and sleeping on the streets?,MIGRANTS,14,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Poverty, Eviction, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, mental health issues, unemployment, disability, PSD, failed asylum applicationsâ€¦itâ€™s a long list.",MIGRANTS,14,3,CN,dialo_gold
You agree that immigration is a contributor then?,MIGRANTS,14,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes of course, but only a small factor amongst many. Ask yourself, if we had no immigration, would that solve the housing shortage on its own?",MIGRANTS,14,5,CN,dialo_gold
It might be a start.,MIGRANTS,14,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Iâ€™d rather see more houses built, the empties let to tenants, adequate support for the homeless, the mentally ill and ex-service personnel, alongside the de-decriminalisation and support for people with addiction. That would be a better start.",MIGRANTS,14,7,CN,dialo_gold
"All these asylum seekers coming here and taking jobs away from native brits, no wonder this country is in a mess.",MIGRANTS,15,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Asylum seekers arenâ€™t actually allowed to work in the UK until they get refugee status, and often take jobs that native Brits donâ€™t want. Also, many people who migrate here start businesses, creating more jobs!",MIGRANTS,15,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Theyâ€™ll do it for less than minimum wage though, so we donâ€™t get offered the jobs because theyâ€™ll do it for cheaper.",MIGRANTS,15,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Thatâ€™s the fault of exploitative employers who donâ€™t want to pay their workers properly, not the refugees for trying to make a living.",MIGRANTS,15,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Women getting into the labour market has caused the downfall of Western civilisation, they should be at home raising children. Abandoning traditional roles is the ruin of society.",WOMEN,16,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Iâ€™d disagree, women should be able to choose what they do, but also even if some women did want to stay at home, many donâ€™t have a choice anymore! Itâ€™s impossible to support a family on 1 wage now.",WOMEN,16,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Oh really? It didnâ€™t used to be impossible, it used to be the norm, whatâ€™s changed?",WOMEN,16,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The cost of living has increased rapidly whilst wages have stagnated over the last few decades. This means that whilst 1 full time wage used to support a family, now with proportionately higher prices for things like food and housing, this isnâ€™t possible.",WOMEN,16,3,CN,dialo_gold
"The trans agenda donâ€™t want mens and womens toilets, everything has to be â€˜all in 1â€™ now. Is this the future we want? Risking womens safety just so men in dresses feel comfortable?",LGBT+,17,0,HS,dialo_gold
"In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.",LGBT+,17,1,CN,dialo_gold
But many wont and many will feel aggrieved by them. You choose to go to that bar/cafe but public toilets will obviously become a problem.,LGBT+,17,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yeah, it's bound to be unfamiliar to some people, but I'm just saying it can work without there being issues/conflict. It's a question of what the norm is. A lot of student unions and universities today have gender neutral toilets, so that generation will be generally okay with it.",LGBT+,17,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Immigrants add to the cost of the NHS, get loads of money in benefits, and create a housing shortage. Time to close the borders.",MIGRANTS,18,0,HS,dialo_gold
"They also pay taxes, contributing to the cost of these services, and are less likely than native Brits to claim benefits, as many are not entitled to it!",MIGRANTS,18,1,CN,dialo_gold
"They still cost us a lot as a country, and if they're not on benefits it means there are less jobs for British people too",MIGRANTS,18,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Immigrants are also more likely to be business owners, meaning they create jobs.",MIGRANTS,18,3,CN,dialo_gold
They probably only hire their own though,MIGRANTS,18,4,HS,dialo_gold
Are you annoyed that immigrants are getting benefits or that they're taking jobs? Make up your mind,MIGRANTS,18,5,CN,dialo_gold
Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?,LGBT+,19,0,HS,dialo_gold
If you consider supporting the LGBT+ community to be 'woke nonsense' then that sounds like your problem...,LGBT+,19,1,CN,dialo_gold
"We just don't need to see it everywhere, even the trains are no longer free of it. This is the start of them spreading their agenda.",LGBT+,19,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The LGBT+ community doesn't have an 'agenda' but public shows of support like this show people that homophobia and transphobia are unacceptable, and this might help some people feel safer in public spaces!",LGBT+,19,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Soon it will be 'sexist' to even talk to birds, everyone gets offended so easily these days you can't say anything.",WOMEN,20,0,HS,dialo_gold
If you talk to women like they're people not 'birds' you shouldn't have a problem!,WOMEN,20,1,CN,dialo_gold
I'll call them what I want,WOMEN,20,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Well, treating people with respect, like not using dehumanising or derogatory terms towards them, is usually a good idea if you want to be treated with respect back!",WOMEN,20,3,CN,dialo_gold
All these muslims coming over here want to enforce sharia law and take over. We cannot submit!!!,MUSLIMS,21,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else",MUSLIMS,21,1,CN,dialo_gold
"There's so many of them though, they're trying to replace us",MUSLIMS,21,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Only around 5% of the UK population are Muslim, non-Muslims are definitely not being replaced!",MUSLIMS,21,3,CN,dialo_gold
All muslims are terrorists!,MUSLIMS,22,0,HS,dialo_gold
"That's not true, and it's a big generalisation, terrorists come from many backgrounds and religions, terrorism is not an exclusively Muslim issue",MUSLIMS,22,1,CN,dialo_gold
So you're saying there are no Muslim terrorists?? Wake up,MUSLIMS,22,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, there obviously are some terrorists who are Muslim, but the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and are appalled by the actions of those who commit violent acts of extremism",MUSLIMS,22,3,CN,dialo_gold
Jews want to take over the world and decimate Western civilisation!,JEWS,23,0,HS,dialo_gold
"That's not true, where did you hear that?",JEWS,23,1,CN,dialo_gold
Have you heard of the great replacement? You should look it up. Jews are using their power to ruin the West and replace white people.,JEWS,23,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The great replacement is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. Yes, there are some Jewish people in high powered positions but this doesn't mean these people are using their power to 'replace white people'.",JEWS,23,3,CN,dialo_gold
Gay people need to live separately from us so we don't catch AIDS from them.,LGBT+,24,0,HS,dialo_gold
"The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's was weaponised to spread homophobia and demonise gay people. Anybody can get HIV, straight or gay, and the vast majority of gay people do not have this illness. Those who do can manage their condition with daily medication, which makes it impossible to transmit.",LGBT+,24,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It's a gay disease, straight people don't get AIDS",LGBT+,24,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes they do, HIV which can develop into AIDS is actually more likely to be undiscovered in straight people, meaning there is more risk of it spreading. This is because after the epidemic the LGBT community became hyperaware of the risk, and generally get tested more.",LGBT+,24,3,CN,dialo_gold
"If black people aren't all criminals, why are they disproportionately arrested and taking up space in our prisons?",POC,25,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.",POC,25,1,CN,dialo_gold
You can't blame everything on 'institutional racism',POC,25,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, you can't, but it explains why more black people committing the same crimes that white people commit get caught. This is especially true for drug offenses, where white people are just as likely if not more likely to be in possession of drugs, but are way less likely to be searched.",POC,25,3,CN,dialo_gold
"More boats at Dover today, the migrant invasion continuesâ€¦",MIGRANTS,26,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Itâ€™s not a planned â€˜invasionâ€™, theyâ€™re refugees fleeing to safety.",MIGRANTS,26,1,CN,dialo_gold
If theyâ€™re really â€˜refugeesâ€™ why didnâ€™t they stop in the first safe country they got to?,MIGRANTS,26,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Some people come to the UK because they have family here, or speak English already, also not all countries that we consider â€˜safeâ€™ are safe for refugees, given the way theyâ€™re treated by the Police in some places.",MIGRANTS,26,3,CN,dialo_gold
SHARE if you think homeless veterans should be housed before any refugees!,MIGRANTS,27,0,HS,dialo_gold
Both veterans and refugees should be housed! There is enough housing for all however a lack of social and affordable housing means lots of places lie empty. Everyone deserves to have a roof over their head.,MIGRANTS,27,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Veterans go to the bottom of the list like everybody else once they've left the barracks and army housing, we have to petition our own government to protect them.",MIGRANTS,27,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes I agree! In a country with this much wealth there should be protection for all vulnerable people, veteran or refugee.",MIGRANTS,27,3,CN,dialo_gold
Why donâ€™t all these Muslim refugees go to other wonderful Muslim countries? Am I missing something?,MUSLIMS,28,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Actually, Muslim countries like Turkey, Pakistan, and Jordan take more refugees than any other countries. The percentage of refugees that come to the UK is tiny in comparison to the full amount of displaced people from conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, etc.",MUSLIMS,28,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Why do we have so many coming here across the channel then? Weâ€™re full, thereâ€™s no room for them here.",MUSLIMS,28,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The number of displaced people is very high right now, and just as other countries are doing, we need to take our fair share. I would argue we definitely have a responsibility, especially since the UK has played a part in some of the conflicts that displaced them.",MUSLIMS,28,3,CN,dialo_gold
How is it our fault if thereâ€™s a war in some third world country?,MUSLIMS,28,4,HS,dialo_gold
UK manufacturers profit from selling military equipment and weapons to these countries. The least we can do is help people who are fleeing violence there.,MUSLIMS,28,5,CN,dialo_gold
"LGBT history month now being taught in schoolsâ€¦ Iâ€™m sick of this being shoved down our throats, what happened to British, European and World history being taught? Identity politics gone mad.",LGBT+,29,0,HS,dialo_gold
"We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!",LGBT+,29,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Do we have to discuss the sexuality of everyone in history when itâ€™s largely irrelevant? If they were persecuted for it then fair enough, stick it in there and say how wrong it was, otherwise leave well alone.",LGBT+,29,2,HS,dialo_gold
"LGBT people have been persecuted until recently in the UK, and it's still illegal to be gay in over 70 countries. I think it's important that people see that there have always been LGBT people, throughout history and that LGBT identities are not 'new' or a 'trend', they're real.",LGBT+,29,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Jews are so greedy, they're always thinking about money",JEWS,30,0,HS,dialo_gold
That's a sweeping generalisation and an incorrect stereotype. You can't tar all Jewish people with the same brush! There's also a lot of 'greedy' people who aren't Jewish,JEWS,30,1,CN,dialo_gold
I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy,JEWS,30,2,HS,dialo_gold
"From the way you're talking, it sounds like you haven't met many Jewish people at all. Maybe you need to interact with more people who are different from you, to understand their perspectives.",JEWS,30,3,CN,dialo_gold
Feminism gives women the muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands.,WOMEN,31,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Nope, feminism is believing that a woman can go to work, have a husband, do both or neither, and all of those options are fine as long as it's what she wants to do.",WOMEN,31,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Itâ€™s ok for who? For the long term of our civilisation? Groups that have more children, like Muslims, will grow and those who don't, like white women, will decline. Women need to be prioritising having a family.",WOMEN,31,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Women don't owe you children, if they don't want to have them and want to prioritise other things instead they have a right to. Children are a big commitment.",WOMEN,31,3,CN,dialo_gold

LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.,LGBT+,32,0,HS,dialo_gold
Why do you feel like LGBT people are dangerous?,LGBT+,32,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It's a slippery slope, first we accept gays and transgenders, next it will be pedophiles.",LGBT+,32,2,HS,dialo_gold
There is no link between the LGBT+ community and paedophiles. These things have no connection.,LGBT+,32,3,CN,dialo_gold

"No, I'm saying paedophilia and child abuse is not an LGBT+ issue, paedophiles can be straight, gay, or whatever else. People in the LGBT+ community are not advocating for paedophilia to be accepted, that's a false and harmful conception.",LGBT+,32,5,CN,dialo_gold

What about what happened in Rotherham and Rochdale? Grooming gangs are a big problem.,MUSLIMS,34,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes, the abuse carried out by Muslim grooming gangs in those places was horrific and can't be ignored, but sexual assault is extremely common unfortuately, and is usually committed in the home, often by a partner, family member, or someone known to the victim. This means that the vast majority of sexual assaults are not committed by Muslims.",MUSLIMS,34,3,CN,dialo_gold

It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.,MIGRANTS,58,0,HS,dialo_gold
"It's definitely a disgrace that in such a rich country we leave homeless people on the streets, especially when there's actually enough housing for everyone it's just not distributed properly.

But shouldn't we be putting our homeless veterans in the hotels and houses that migrants get? That makes a lot more sense to me,MIGRANTS,58,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, because there actually is enough housing for everyone, it's just distributed unevenly. The government has decimated it's supply of social housing over the last few decades, and many cities are filled with overpriced unsold flats. If we could repurpose some of these builds, or if they could be let out at a more affordable rate, we wouldn't have this problem.",MIGRANTS,58,3,CN,dialo_gold

What about the huge cost of it though? We need to stamp out health tourism,MIGRANTS,60,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Actually, heath tourism makes up about 0.3% of the total NHS budget, so whilst some people might exploit it, it's not a big problem. A bigger problem is how underfunded the NHS is and how it's staff's wages haven't risen for years!",MIGRANTS,60,3,CN,dialo_gold

Are you sure? If they're getting benefits for free why would they?,MIGRANTS,61,2,HS,dialo_gold

Surely the problem here is not the migrants trying to make a living but the exploitative employers who are hiring people for less than minimum wage and underpaying them?,MIGRANTS,62,1,CN,dialo_gold

What do you mean by that? There are no countries that say â€˜no white peopleâ€™.,POC,110,1,CN,dialo_gold
Asian and African countries donâ€™t have to take the sort of mass migration that we do from their countries. This means thereâ€™s less and less white people in the UK but their countries stay true to their ethnic heritage.,POC,110,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Iâ€™d object to the idea that the UK is a â€˜white countryâ€™, peopleâ€™s nationality isnâ€™t defined by their skin colour. There are plenty of people who arenâ€™t white but are as British as anybody else here.",POC,110,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Africa for the Africans, Asia for the Asians, why arenâ€™t we allowed to keep Britain for the British? We are erasing our white population, stop white genocide now.",POC,111,0,HS,dialo_gold
"There is no white genocide happening in the UK, what makes you think that?",POC,111,1,CN,dialo_gold
Migration from black and brown countries is polluting our national ethnic heritage. We have to do something about it before white people are erased all together.,POC,111,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If you see non-white people as â€˜pollutingâ€™ the white race then you need to rethink how you see race. Skin colour has nothing to do with someoneâ€™s national identity, and thereâ€™s definitely not a genocide going on, just normal demographic change.",POC,111,3,CN,dialo_gold
So you admit there is demographic change happening? White people will be a minority by 2066.,POC,111,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes, thereâ€™s demographic change happening, but what Iâ€™m saying is itâ€™s not a planned thing, itâ€™s not genocide, and itâ€™s not a bad, or good thing, itâ€™s just change. The UK population will be more diverse in the future, and thatâ€™s fine!",POC,111,5,CN,dialo_gold
"More crime, more stabbings, more rapes, and what's changed? We've got big black and Asian populations in our cities.",POC,112,0,HS,dialo_gold
"I don't know if you can draw a direct correlation between those things, lots of things have changed in the last few decades that could affect crime rates.",POC,112,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Oh yeah, like what? More ethnic 'minorities' is the biggest difference from 30-40 years ago to now. They're hardly the minority anymore.",POC,112,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The wealth gap has widened massively in recent decades, this has meant more people in poverty who might have to turn to crime for some kind of income.",POC,112,3,CN,dialo_gold
"There are some towns that are 'no go' areas for whites now because the Asian population is so big, this is meant to be the UK, not Pakistan!",POC,113,0,HS,dialo_gold
"I don't think that's true, some newspapers have referred to these areas as 'no go' areas but there's nothing to suggest anything would happen if you as a white person went there.",POC,113,1,CN,dialo_gold
You don't know what they might do to you if they're not used to whites being on their turf.,POC,113,2,HS,dialo_gold

All these blacks from Africa on our football teams but I don't see any English or European players on African teams. 'Enrichment' via diversity seems to be a one way street.,POC,114,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Isn't that because these African players are great footballers, so have been scouted by UK teams because they want players of a high calibre?",POC,114,1,CN,dialo_gold
Maybe but why are they coming over here when there isn't the same happening the other way? Just seems like another way that we are told to be complacent about the growing black African population.,POC,114,2,HS,dialo_gold
"You're complaining that our football teams scout international talent, just because they're black? I don't see the logic, how are you making this out like it's a bad thing, some players from African countries are great assets to UK teams.",POC,114,3,CN,dialo_gold
"If white genocide isn't real then why do pictures of school classes look so different from the 70's vs now. Back then everyone was white except maybe 1 or 2, now there are 2-3 white children in a class of 30 blacks and arabs. We are being invaded.",POC,115,0,HS,dialo_gold
"The demographic makeup of schools varies greatly depending on what area the school is in. Schools in cities and urban areas have more diverse classes, but lots of schools in towns and more rural areas are still overwhelmingly white. You can't generalise this to everywhere.",POC,115,1,CN,dialo_gold
"But you can't deny there's been a big change in some places, whites are being wiped out, we need to fight back.",POC,115,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes there's been changes in some areas but why is that a bad thing? It's not good or bad, demographic change is a neutral phenomenon. White people are hardly a minority in the UK, only in certain areas where other communities have grown, and that's not representative of most of the country.",POC,115,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Went to Londanistan yesterday, not a white face in sight! Just asians and arabs everywhere, if we don't do something soon our culture is going to be erased. Forced multiculturalism has got to stop!",POC,116,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Yeah London is very diverse, why do you feel like this is a bad thing?",POC,116,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It's the capital of the UK, it should be a place where BRITISH culture thrives, not all these other cultures that we've let in and now are allowing to take over.",POC,116,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I think it depends what you think of a British culture. I'm proud to say we live in a diverse country, and that immigration over 100s of years has shaped that culture. These cultures contribute to British culture, they don't detract from it!",POC,116,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Diversity is ruining this country, erasing white culture, erasing white people. Diversity is a code word for white genocide.",POC,117,0,HS,dialo_gold
Just because the UK is diverse doesn't mean that white people are 'being erased'. What do you mean by that?,POC,117,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Even the media encourages race mixing now, there's always families in adverts with white women, black men, and mixed children. Our genes are being erased.",POC,117,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If you see people being in interracial relationships as a problem then you need to rethink how you're viewing the world. Someone's skin colour shouldn't matter to you this much. And I think you're exaggerating about the tv adverts, there's lots of white people on tv.",POC,117,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.",POC,118,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Jeez, a bit extreme don't you think? Just because somebody's culture is different from yours it's no reason to call for violence. And don't think of other continents as the 'third world', just because you don't know much about these countries doesn't make them 'uncivilised' or 'undeveloped'. Educate yourself.",POC,118,1,CN,dialo_gold
Look how far the West has come while blacks in Africa are still living in mud huts. These people are savage and uncivilised.,POC,118,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The development in the West was built on the backs of the millions of black slaves the West brutalised and abused. The West also pillaged these countries, taking their treasures and ownership of their natural resources, and you wonder why some countries are less economically developed. Also, the idea that Africa is just tribes living in huts is very ignorant, some African countries are extremely developed.",POC,118,3,CN,dialo_gold
